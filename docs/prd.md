## Project: beeMÃ´n Scraper Challenge

### Objective
To create a robust, modular Python application to scrape and structure data from `quotes.toscrape.com` and `imdb.com`, supporting advanced features such as scheduling, data storage, and user notification.

---

## Core Features
- Scrape and structure data from selected websites
- Export results to JSON and CSV
- Screenshot capture for each scrape
- CLI interface for all operations
- Execution logs

---

## Extras (Stretch Goals)
- MongoDB storage (flexible schema)
- Notifications via Telegram/Email/SMS
- Run in detached/daemon mode
- Dockerized with `dev` and `prod` flows
- TDD-first development, >95% coverage
- Pandas integration for results preview
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
- Deployment-ready for Azure (optional)

---

## Assumptions
- Website structure may change, so selectors must be dynamic
- Application should be usable from CLI and possibly web
- Users can configure via `.env` or CLI flags
